### Do’s and don’ts
See the [coding guidelines](http://git.mvp.studio/talent-competition/talent-competition/wikis/guides/coding-guidelines) and [FAQ](http://git.mvp.studio/talent-competition/talent-competition/wikis/guides/faqs)  
Please try not to add styles inside the jsx file. Instead, please add your styles to TalentTheme.css.  
Please use ES6, jsx, use state  
Limit your use of javascript or jQuery - jQuery is required for AJAX, but very little else.  
Use AJAX to get/send data to the controller  
Please use plain javascript not typescript  

**Note : Make sure that you have Visual Studio 2017 installed in your computer.
Visual Studio 2015 does not work with ReactJS**

### Install react, babel, webpack, js tokens and react tags:
* Find the folder that contains webpack.config.js in the solution explorer
* Right click on the folder and select 'Open Folder in File Explorer'
* Open command prompt (windows + R, type cmd) and go to the folder that contains webpack.config.js (E.g: cd C:\Talent\Talent\Talent.WebApp\Scripts\react)
Install npm util packages:
`npm install`
* Check webpack version (make sure it's 4.5.0):
`webpack -version`

### Launch Talent project

### React tips
* Common coding mistakes using jsx
* Class names: class (html) => className (jsx), tabindex (html) => tabIndex (jsx)
* Require closing parent element or fragments: https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html
* Jsx Closing tags differ from html tags, you must have a closing tag for images and inputs: `<img></img>, <input</input>`
* Forgetting to turn on webpack : `npm run build`
* Forgetting to clear the cache
